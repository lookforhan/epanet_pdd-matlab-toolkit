# Reasons that they are incorrectly generated

The file -'GWSL_4_RR_IX.txt'- is the first reason. In this file, the fisrt column
is the pipe id that could be damaged. And the data in the column make pipe 75~78
could be damaged, while they should not.

Because the elevation of damaged node is determined by the elevations of the two
end of the pipeline. The elevation of one end of pipe 75~78 are ZERO. Therefore,
these elevations may lead to wrong elevation of damage node and then result in
exaggerating leakage.
